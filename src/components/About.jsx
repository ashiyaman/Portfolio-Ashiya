                I’m Ashiya — a full-stack developer fluent in JavaScript and passionate about building smooth, 
                scalable web apps using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

                I turn complex ideas into clean code and intuitive interfaces. From backend APIs to responsive frontends, 
                I love crafting digital experiences that just work — fast, secure, and user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I’m focused on sharpening my skills in modern frameworks 
                and deploying real-world projects. Always learning, always building.
